# Quantum-Computing-Applications-in-Machine-Learning-and-Cybersecurity
I have performed a literature survey between Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity which contributes to the taxonomy and analysis of methods also I was able to effectively apply ML algorithms in Quantum computer platforms and gain practical work with QML tools such as Qiskit from IBM summer school.

The Responsibilities:

- Systematic download and review of research papers involving QC, ML, and Cybersecurity. 
- Classification of papers based on technical approaches, application domains, and impact. 
- Comparative analysis to extract strengths, weaknesses, and research trends. 
- Implementation of a lab experiment demonstrating ML algorithms using QC tools such as Qiskit or similar frameworks. 
- Training on QC programming concepts, quantum circuits, and architecture to support the lab component. 
- Development of summary tables, visualizations, and recommendations based on the survey.
